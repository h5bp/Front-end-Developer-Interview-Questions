## Coding questions
* Make this work:
```javascript
duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```
* Create a for loop that iterates up to `100` while outputting **"fizz"** at multiples of `3`, **"buzz"** at multiples of `5` and **"fizzbuzz"** at multiples of `3` and `5`
* What will be returned by each of these?
```javascript
console.log("hello" || "world")
console.log("foo" && "bar")
```
* Write an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
