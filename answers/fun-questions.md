# Fun Questions

#### What's a cool project that you've recently worked on?

[Pen](https://github.com/noraesae/pen).

It is a markdown previewer written in JavaScript with realtime preview. The
preview page is updated powered by VirtualDOM of React, which means that only
modified parts in the original markdown are actually updated in the DOM tree of
the preview page. It's super cool(at least I believe). If interested, please
look into it :smile:

#### What are some things you like about the developer tools you use?

I personally use Tmux and Vim with several customisations. I especially
recommend using [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) and
[Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) for Vim.

I won't describe them in detail here, but if you're using Vim, you must love
them.

#### Do you have any pet projects? What kind?

Many. You can find them in [my GitHub page](https://github.com/noraesae).

I like to write useful tools not only for developers, but for normal users.
So many of my pet projects are about tools including markdown previewers,
a input changer, etc. I also write some JavaScript packages as well.

#### What's your favorite feature of Internet Explorer?

What is Internet Explorer? Nevermind. I like the color of its logo.

#### How do you like your coffee?

I'm a fan of coffee. I usually drink cups of coffee a day, especially a working
day.

I also like to drink tea and beer :beer:
