## Pull requests

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project (spelling, indentation, punctuation etc.).

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

5. Squash your commits down to a single one (we want to keep the master branch nice and clean)

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.
